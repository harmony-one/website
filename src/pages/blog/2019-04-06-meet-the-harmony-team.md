### A team of engineers & researchers who have built global-scale infrastructure at Google, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft.

As the newest “node” on the Harmony team, I’m humbled to be working alongside some of the strongest technologists in the world.

The Harmony team is dedicated to building a decentralized protocol that can be used by 1 billion+ people, and eventually 10 billion people.

The team is working to put the best research on the consensus, networking, and systems layer into production. Having built global-scale products at companies including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, our team is excited to create an open consensus protocol that will positively impact people worldwide.

After raising a $18M round earlier this year, Harmony is recruiting Rust/Go language enthusiasts, protocol researchers and database hackers. Apply at harmony.one/careers! Refer your friends to work with us to earn $15,000 bonus.
